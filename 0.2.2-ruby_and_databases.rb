# TODO - Need to be able to pass the grade level as an argument, look in schema for "grade_current" column

# TODO - Make a method to print the following states representatives as well:

##### BONUS #######
# TODO (bonus) - Stop SQL injection attacks!  Statmaster learned that interpolation of variables in SQL statements leaves some security vulnerabilities.  Use the google to figure out how to protect from this type of attack.

# TODO (bonus)
# Create a listing of all of the Politicians and the number of votes they recieved
# output should look like:  Sen. John McCain - 7,323 votes
# Create a listing of each Politician and the voter that voted for them
# output should include the senators name, then a long list of voters separated by a comma
#
# * you'll need to do some join statements to complete these last queries!
