As you are debugging, ask yourself:
* Do you have enough information to decipher the problem?  
* Is the error message referencing a line in your file, or a different file?
* Is there a methodology that you are following to systematically tackle these bugs?  What is a step by step approach? 


###2) Decipher the bugs
For each bug (there are three initial bugs that cause interpreter errors), answer the following questions:

--- Bug 1 ---
* what is the exact description of the error?
* what is the exact line number the error is appearing?
* before you fix the bug, what do you think is wrong?

--- Bug 2 ---
* what is the exact description of the error?
* what is the exact line number the error is appearing?
* before you fix the bug, what do you think is wrong?

--- Bug 3 ---
* what is the exact description of the error?
* what is the exact line number the error is appearing?
* before you fix the bug, what do you think is wrong?


###3) Pass the tests 

--- Last Bug ---
The last bug isn't causing interpreter errors, but it's causing the output of the program to fail the RSpec tests.  

When you solve the error, describe what is happening as clearly as possible:


###4) Review your process and methodology

* What were your steps to tackle this problem?

* Write down the processes you followed that could be applied in other debugging situations.


###5) Submit and review

Review other solutions.
* What was their approach? Did they have a step that could be particularly useful?
* Add any insights to your gist to help distill your own process.
