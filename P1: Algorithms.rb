## ADD YOUR CODE HERE and IN THE CLASS ABOVE

#1. Create an array of 5 Students each with 5 test scores between 0 and 100.  
# The first Student should be named "Alex" with scores [100,100,100,0,100]


#2. Add average and letter_grade methods to the Student class.


#3. Write a linear_search method that searches the student array for a student name
# and returns the position of that student if they are in the array.

#4. Write a bubble_sort method that sorts the array of students by first_name.




#===========DRIVER CODE : DO NOT MODIFY =======

#Make sure these tests pass
# Tests for part 1:

p students[0].name == "Alex"
p students[0].scores.length ==5
p students[0].scores[0]==students[0].scores[4]
p students[0].scores[3]==0


# Tests for part 2

p students[0].average == 80
p students[0].letter_grade == 'B'

# Tests for part 3

p linear_search(students,"Alex")==0
p linear_search(students, "NOT A STUDENT")==-1

#Tests for part 4
bubble_sort(students)

# The first student should still be Alex
p students[0].name == "Alex"
p students[0].scores[0]==100

# The students should be in order by name
p students[0].name <= students[1].name
p students[2].name <= students[3].name
p students[3].name <= students[4].name
